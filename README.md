# Weather-Vista
A real-time weather app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches weather data using the Open-Meteo API and displays it in a beautiful, responsive interface.
Interface Design:
Live Location Button: Positioned at the top of the app interface, labeled "Live Location," which users can tap to fetch current weather data for their location.

Search Input Field: Below the "Live Location" button, an input field where users can enter the name of a city or place to get weather information.

Weather Details Display: A section where weather information such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity is shown.

Functionality:
Live Location: When users tap the "Live Location" button, the app requests location permissions and fetches the current geographic coordinates. Then, it displays the current weather data for that location.

Search by Location: Users can enter any city or place name in the search field. Upon submission, the app retrieves and displays the weather details for the searched location.

Weather Details: The app fetches and displays the temperature, wind speed, for the chosen location, either by live location or searched location.

User Experience:
Interactive & Intuitive: The live location button should provide immediate feedback if location data is retrieved successfully or if there are issues with location permissions.

Responsive & Real-Time: The weather details should update in real-time based on the user's input or live location data.

Visual Appeal: Use weather icons and appropriate styling to make the app visually appealing and easy to read.
